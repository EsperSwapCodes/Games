Status:Complete.

# Game no#2 -EsperSwap's bar management game:
A match 3 game taking place inside a bar, the player plays the aforementioned game to earn money which they can spend on bar customization and additional characters.
Written in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Version 0.1:
The basic tile swapping system is now functional as is a large amount of background variables that the game may use at a later date. Development seems promising so far.
