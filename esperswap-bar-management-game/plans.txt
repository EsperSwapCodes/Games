//CODESTUFF:
-A timer initiates upon player input (Puzzlestuck style), lasting about 4-5 seconds, with a HUD element to match. (use a bool to determine whether or not the timer is running and a unique set of timer specific functions, reduce the timer in the milisecond frame-by-frame function, hud element is drawn inside the same function but a seperate function is used, relegate grid drawing and level generation to seperate functions as well, for convenience's sake.
-An enemy health system is implemented, that reduces upon drinks matched, when reduced to 0, the player recieves payment.
-add a tile clear function that identifies clusters and removes all "hotpink" tiles
-a combo variable that steps up every sucessfull drink serving, ramping up the price of service and enemy healthbars alongside a "level" variable that the player can change on the map screen
-combo system that makes drink reduction easier with more matches made
